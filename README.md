# VelociCycle Data Warehouse Project

## About
VelociCycle is an innovative outdoor gear brand, specializing in high-end bicycles and accessories. They operate both online and in select physical stores across Australia. Their customer base includes recreational riders, urban commuters, and cycling enthusiasts who value quality and performance.

Over the past few years, VelociCycle has seen rapid growth in both product offerings and customer base. Their systems now generate a large amount of structured data across customer demographics, locations, product catalogs, and sales transactions. However, the data is currently spread across multiple siloed datasets with redundant and inconsistently formatted information.

## Project Requirement
This project aims to build a scalable data warehouse that would lead to generating actionable insights. 
The goal is to transform fragmented and unstructured datasets into a **clean, scalable, and query-optimized data warehouse** to support advanced analytics, reporting, and business decision-making.


## Data Architecture

The data architecture follows the Medallion Archtecture of having a bronze, silver, and gold layer.
